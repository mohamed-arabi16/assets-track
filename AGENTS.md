This is a starter template for a new project with Vite, React, Shadcn, and TypeScript.

To get started, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and open the project in your browser.

To build the project for production, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder with the production-ready files.
